## Prelude

The data set `pollution.csv` contains the following variables.

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- | 
| Temperature (°C)                    | Average temperature of the region. |
| Humidity (%)                        | Relative humidity recorded in the region. |
| PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³)         | Fine particulate matter levels. |
| PM10 Concentration (µg/m³)          | Coarse particulate matter levels. |
| NO2 Concentration (ppb)             | Nitrogen dioxide levels. |
| SO2 Concentration (ppb)             | Sulfur dioxide levels. |
| CO Concentration (ppm)              | Carbon monoxide levels. |
| Proximity to Industrial Areas (km)  | Distance to the nearest industrial zone. |
| Population Density (people/km²)     | Number of people per square kilometer in the region. |
| Air Quality Levels                  | Quantification of air quality **Target**. |
